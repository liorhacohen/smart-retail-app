## 🔧 Stage 1: Lint and Format Code

### What it does:
- Checks Python code quality with flake8, black, and isort
- Lints React/JavaScript code with ESLint
- Ensures consistent code formatting

### Tools Used:
- **flake8**: Python linting for style and errors
- **black**: Python code formatter
- **isort**: Python import sorter
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/React linting

### Configuration Files:
- `.flake8` - flake8 configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - black and isort configuration
- `frontend/.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration

### How it works:
```yaml
lint-and-format:
  steps:
    - Set up Python and Node.js environments
    - Install linting tools
    - Run flake8 for Python code quality
    - Run black and isort for formatting
    - Run ESLint for React code
```

### Why it's important:
- Catches syntax errors early
- Ensures consistent code style
- Prevents common bugs
- Makes code reviews easier

- Validates API endpoints

### Tools Used:
- **pytest**: Python testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **React Testing Library**: Frontend testing
- **PostgreSQL**: Test database

### Test Structure:
```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── test_app.py          # Backend API tests
└── frontend/src/        # React component tests
```

### Key Test Categories:
1. **Health Check Tests**: Verify API availability
